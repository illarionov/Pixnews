 * - [AsyncImagePainter] will not finish loading if [AsyncImagePainter.onDraw] is not called.
 *   This can occur if a composable has an unbounded (i.e. [Constraints.Infinity]) width/height
 *   constraint. For example, to use [AsyncImagePainter] with [LazyRow] or [LazyColumn], you must
 *   set a bounded width or height respectively using `Modifier.width` or `Modifier.height`.
 * - [AsyncImagePainter.state] will not transition to [State.Success] synchronously during the
 *   composition phase. Use [SubcomposeAsyncImage] or set a custom [ImageRequest.Builder.size] value
 *   (e.g. `size(Size.ORIGINAL)`) if you need this.
 *
 * @param model Either an [ImageRequest] or the [ImageRequest.data] value.
 * @param placeholder A [Painter] that is displayed while the image is loading.
 * @param error A [Painter] that is displayed when the image request is unsuccessful.
 * @param fallback A [Painter] that is displayed when the request's [ImageRequest.data] is null.
 * @param onLoading Called when the image request begins loading.
 * @param onSuccess Called when the image request completes successfully.
 * @param onError Called when the image request completes unsuccessfully.
 * @param contentScale Used to determine the aspect ratio scaling to be used if the canvas bounds
 *  are a different size from the intrinsic size of the image loaded by [model]. This should be set
 *  to the same value that's passed to [Image].
 * @param filterQuality Sampling algorithm applied to a bitmap when it is scaled and drawn into the
 *  destination.
